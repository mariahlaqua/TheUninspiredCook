# TheUninspiredCook
A simple web app built with [theMealDB.](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) Click the button to have a recipe, ingredients and instructions for a random recipe appear.

Built with CSS, HTML & Vanilla JS. Demonstrates basic DOM manipulation with JS, client-side API fetching & rendering API results.

The main.js file is a mess, this is in part due to issues with the API itself. Ingredients do not always have consistent formatting within the database.

Currently, this project is being reworked with React.js. The updated version will attempt to resolve some of the issues from the API results/main.js coding. This project will remain available as a tool for comparison for those learning React after learing vanilla JS DOM manipulation.

### Future Optimizations:
- [] main.js further code cleanup. There are better methods for handling both the fetch, and the response.

### Live version
